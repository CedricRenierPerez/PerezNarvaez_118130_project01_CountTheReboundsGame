Count the Rebounds Game
The user creates a court were the ball will rebound, then he will
center the ball somewhere in the court and the ball will start
bouncing before it stops, the person playing the game must count
each rebound to win a point, if a new highscore is reached
that users data is saved in a file along with its score.
